PLACEHOLDER IMAGE:

This is a placeholder for the 'src/assets/images/who-knew-visual.png' image file.

The hueneu application expects an actual PNG image at this location.
This image is intended to be used for the "Who Knew?" visual pop-out or scroll-triggered element within 'The hueneu Story' section of the website, as described in the project plan.

Please REPLACE this text file with your desired PNG image.

For example, you could create a visual that embodies a fun surprise or a creative insight related to the hueneu brand.
If you need a temporary visual, you can generate one using a service like:
https://via.placeholder.com/600x400/FFB6C1/000000?text=Who+Knew+Visual!
(Remember to download the image and save it as 'who-knew-visual.png' in this directory: 'src/assets/images/')
